#Intro
Having desire to comprehend Qt I wanted to create some application but had no idea. Fortunnately my friend game designer presented me his vision of this game.
Despite on plenty game engines that suit much more better for it, I decided  stick to the first intention.
#About
It will be a card game which lots on the Internet but as my friend, GD, affirmes with new mechanics. Let's hope so)
Using Qt 5.3, I build it for linux (Debian) and Android (API 16).

I haven't yet made AndroidManifest.xml, so on Android the application better to run in horizontal screen orientation.
